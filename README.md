Easybank landing page

This is a solution to the [Easybank landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. In this case I added some animations that are activate by the scroll event when the elements reach a trigger point of 100 in the window.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

Mobile view: (375px)

You can see all the animations, hover effects and the accordeon type menu for the mobile view on the link of the live site url. The SASS file was use to make a visual grid for the elements of the page, this makes it more maintanable, separating the position, displays, margins, paddings from the more style properties of CSS like color, background, transitions, animations, fonts.
